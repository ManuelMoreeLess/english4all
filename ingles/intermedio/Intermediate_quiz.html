            <h1>The Genesis of the Internet</h1>
            <div id="intro-text">
         The Internet, a global network of interconnected computers, has its roots in the 1960s as a project of the United States government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The project, known as ARPANET, was initially designed to create a resilient and decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack. The first successful message was sent over ARPANET on October 29, 1969, between UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the network grew, primarily connecting universities and research institutions. A significant milestone was the development of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) in the early 1980s, which became the standard protocol for the Internet and allowed different types of networks to connect. The 1990s marked the dawn of the public, commercial Internet. A key invention was the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990. He created the first web browser, web server, and the fundamental technologies: HTML, URL, and HTTP. This made the Internet vastly more accessible to the general public. In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was released, which was the first browser to display images inline with text, sparking a massive surge in the Internet's popularity. By the mid-1990s, companies like Netscape and later Microsoft, with Internet Explorer, brought the web to millions of households worldwide. The term for this era is often called the 'Dot-com boom'.
